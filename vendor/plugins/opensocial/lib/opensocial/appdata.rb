module OpenSocial #:nodoc:
  
  # Acts as a wrapper for an OpenSocial appdata entry.
  #
  # The AppData class takes a person's ID and input JSON as initialization
  # parameters, and iterates through each of the key/value pairs of that JSON.
  # For each key that is found, an attr_accessor is constructed (except for
  # :id which is preconstructed, and required), allowing direct access to the
  # value. Each value is stored in the attr_accessor, either as a String,
  # Fixnum, Hash, or Array.
  #
  
  
  class AppData < Base
    attr_accessor :id
    
    # Initializes the AppData entry based on the provided id and json fragment.
    # If no JSON is provided, an empty object (with only an ID) is created.
    def initialize(id, json)
      @id = id
