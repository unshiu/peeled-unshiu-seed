module OpenSocial #:nodoc:
  
  # Acts as a wrapper for an OpenSocial activity.
  #
  # The Activity class takes input JSON as an initialization parameter, and
  # iterates through each of the key/value pairs of that JSON. For each key
  # that is found, an attr_accessor is constructed, allowing direct access
  # to the value. Each value is stored in the attr_accessor, either as a
  # String, Fixnum, Hash, or Array.
  #
  
  
  class Activity < Base
    
    # Initializes the Activity based on the provided json fragment. If no JSON
    # is provided, an empty object (with no attributes) is created.

  # The FetchActivitiesRequest wraps a simple request to an OpenSocial
  # endpoint for a Collection of activities. As parameters, it accepts
  # a user ID and selector (and optionally an ID of a particular activity).
  # This request may be used, standalone, by calling send, or bundled into
  # an RpcRequest.
